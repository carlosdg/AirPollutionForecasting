# Helper Program To Download Canary Islands Air Quality Data

This is a helper program for a project. The goal was to use air quality data for a data science project. The problem was that the [page for downloading the data](http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/medioambiente/calidaddelaire/datosHistoricos.do) doesn't have an API for programmatically downloading the data, a form has to be filled for each year, month and area and it takes a lot of time. Also it is very easy to do something wrong. So this project was made to make the form fill easier without abusing the system and trying to make the POST request directly.
